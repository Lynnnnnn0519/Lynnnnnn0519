## Hi there 👋
🚀I'm Tinghuan(Lynn)  Li  — A data scientist in training with a serious crush on **Deep Learning**!

🎓 Currently pursuing an MS in Analytics @ USC | Completed a BS in Data Science

🧠 On a self-driven quest into the world of **Machine Learning** — where machines *see*, *learn*, and sometimes even surprise us. Still learning, still experimenting, and hoping to turn all this curiosity into something useful in the real world  — from ICU survival chances to UAV targets to movie recommendations. 

🔍 What started as pure curiosity, combined with unwavering passion, led me to hands-on exploration: I dove into object detection, YOLO models, and attention mechanisms — all self-taught, just for the thrill of building something smart from scratch.

🧰 **Tech Toolbox:**
 ・Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
 ・SQL | Tableau | MATLAB | Linux
 ・Big Data: Hadoop, HBase, Hive, Spark
